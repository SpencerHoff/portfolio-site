								<p>For this project, I tasked myself with creating a potential redesign for a local comic book shop, Books Comics and Things. I used this store as it would be a solid piece for my portfolio, their current website could use a redesign, and because I have personally visited the store myself on several occasions.</p>

								<p>For this assignment, our class was tasked with using Wordpress on a hosted site in order to create our own site using a template from wordpress. As for me, I chose to create an Elden Ring fan-site, that covered the lore and world surrounding said game. </p>

									<h2>"Chrome Junkies" - Cyberpunk 2077 Fan-Site (Fall 2022)</h2>

								<p>As the final project for my first semester of web design, we had a more open-ended project, allowing us to create a site using what we had learned throught the semester so far. At the time, I had recently become heavily invested in a video game called "Cyberpunk 2077", and wanted to create a site that looked like it could be within the world of the game. This site would show individuals where to buy "Chrome" (technological body modifications), and would tell users about different doctors around the city.</p>

									<h2>CSS Zen Garden (Fall 2022)</h2>

								<p>As one of my first projects, I took part in the CSS Zen Garden project, which is a project from a website of thje same name that tasks designers to show the possibilities of CSS when designing for the web. Everyone gets the exact same content and html, and all of the design comes strictly from the CSS.</p>
